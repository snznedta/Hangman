For millions users to use our game at the same time, we need several changes:
1. Change database backend from sqlite3 to MySQL or AWS RDBMS(distributed version of SQL database) to handle more data
2. Using a load balancer to handle balancing. We can redirect user's request to its target backend based on the hash on
 user's id. The load balancer also need to generate global unique GameID.
3. Deploy django app on Apache/nginx server for production environment.
4. We could even integrate app to docker container so that we can doing auto scaling on cloud easier.
